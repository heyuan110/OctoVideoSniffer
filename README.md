### ‚¨áÔ∏è Downloading M3U8 Videos

**Requires Python and FFmpeg environment.**


To download M3U8 videos after exporting `videos.json` with the OctoVideoSniffer plugin:

1.  **Export `videos.json`:** Use the OctoVideoSniffer browser extension to export the `videos.json` file from the webpage containing the M3U8 video.
2.  **Navigate to `download_m3u8` directory:** Open your command line interface and change your current directory to the `download_m3u8` folder within the cloned repository.
    ```bash
    cd path/to/OctoVideoSniffer/download_m3u8
    ```
3.  **Copy `videos.json`:** Place the exported `videos.json` file into this `download_m3u8` directory.
4.  **Run `cmd.py`:** Execute the `cmd.py` script from within the `download_m3u8` directory. It will automatically detect and download the M3U8 videos listed in your `videos.json` file.
    ```bash
    python cmd.py
    ```
    (Use `python3 cmd.py` if your system uses `python` for Python 2.)
